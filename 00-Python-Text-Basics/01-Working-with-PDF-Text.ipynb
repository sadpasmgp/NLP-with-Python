PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted, or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to be read. If you find yourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.\n",
