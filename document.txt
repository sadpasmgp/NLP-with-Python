Your Turn: Create a file called document.txt using a text editor, and type in a few lines of text, and save it as plain text. If you are using IDLE, select the New Window command in the File menu, typing the required text into this window, and then saving the file as document.txt inside the directory that IDLE offers in the pop-up dialogue box. Next, in the Python interpreter, open the file using f = open('document.txt'), then inspect its contents using print(f.read()).
