    "The web can be thought of as a huge corpus of unannotated text. Web search engines provide an efficient means of searching this large quantity of text for relevant linguistic examples. The main advantage of search engines is size: since you are searching such a large set of documents, you are more likely to find any linguistic pattern you are interested in. Furthermore, you can make use of very specific patterns, which would only match one or two examples on a smaller example, but which might match tens of thousands of examples when run on the web. A second advantage of web search engines is that they are very easy to use. Thus, they provide a very convenient tool for quickly checking a theory, to see if it is reasonable."

    "Unfortunately, search engines have some significant shortcomings. First, the allowable range of search patterns is severely restricted. Unlike local corpora, where you write programs to search for arbitrarily complex patterns, search engines generally only allow you to search for individual words or strings of words, sometimes with wildcards. Second, search engines give inconsistent results, and can give widely different figures when used at different times or in different geographical regions. When content has been duplicated across multiple sites, search results may be boosted. Finally, the markup in the result returned by a search engine may change unpredictably, breaking any pattern-based method of locating particular content (a problem which is ameliorated by the use of search engine APIs)."

The Calaveras Jumping Frogs? I dunno.</span></p>\\n<p>And his closing: \"I leave you to identify a linguistics hook!\"</p>\\n<p><span id=\"more-51655\"></span></p>\\n<p>The most obvious hook is the etymological one &#8212; how did the common name of Chiroptera come to be the same as the word for \"A stick or stout piece of wood\", and especially for the stick-like objects that play a role in cricket, baseball, etc.</p>\\n<p>The OED\\'s etymology for the \"stick\" meaning is already complicated:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As the nominative singular does not occur in 13th cent., it is uncertain whether it was <em>bat</em> or <em>batte</em>, and thus whether it was an adoption of Old French <em>batte</em> (partly identical in sense, referred by Littré to <em>battre</em> to beat), or represented an Old English <em>*bat</em> (feminine) ‘fustis,’ alleged by Somner, from an unknown source. The forms in Layamon rather favour the latter; but in any case some of the senses are from French <em>batte</em>. The supposed Old English <em>*bat</em> is by some referred to a Celtic origin; compare Irish and Gaelic <em>bat</em>, <em>bata</em> staff, cudgel. The development and relations of the senses are obscure: some of them appear to be from the verb, and some may be immediately due to onomatopoeia, from the sound of a solid, slightly dull, blow: compare <em>pat</em>. Thus there may be two or three originally distinct words, though no longer satisfactorily separable.</p>\\n<p>And the etymology of the Chiroptera sense is just as tangled, but mostly separate:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The modern <em>bat</em>, found c1575, takes the place of Middle English <em>bakke</em>, apparently &lt; Scandinavian; compare Danish <em>aften-bakke</em> ‘evening-bat,’ Old Danish <em>nath-bakkæ</em>, Old Swedish (Ihre) <em>natt-backa</em> ‘night-bat.’ Swedish dialect have also <em>natt-batta</em>. n<em>att-blacka</em>: with the latter compare Icelandic l<em>eðr-blaka</em> ‘bat,’ lit. ‘leather-flutterer,’ &lt; <em>blaka</em> ‘to flap, wave, flutter with wings,’ whence it has been suggested that <em>bakke, backa</em> have lost an l; but as the l does not appear in the Old Swedish and Old Danish forms above, this is very unlikely. The medieval Latin <em>blatta, blacta, batta</em>, glossed ‘lucifuga, vespertilio, vledermus’ (Diefenbach Suppl. to Du Cange) = classical Latin <em>blatta</em> ‘an insect that shuns the light’ (<em>blattae lucifugae</em>, Vergil) ‘cockroach, moth,’ is distinct in origin, but may have influenced the English change to <em>bat</em>; evidence is wanting. <em>Back-</em> in combination, <em>backie-bird</em>, <em>bawkie-bird</em> still survive in north English and Sc.</p>\\n<p>So it\\'s not a surprise that stout sticks and Chiroptera have different names in most (all?) other languages.</p>\\n<p>Some years ago, our room in a nice Taipei hotel had a bat hanging in the window curtains, who flew around the room when we entered, and resisted our attempts to persuade it to leave. On heading out for our next local event, we described the bat problem to the helpful staff at the front desk, whose English seemed to be excellent. And when we returned a few hours later, they helpfully presented us with a <a href=\"https://www.slugger.com/en-us/baseball/wood/series-5/series-5-legacy-ash-c271-baseball-bat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Louisville Slugger</a>. I hate to imagine what they thought we wanted to do with it.</p>\\n<p>As I recall, a short impromptu language lesson resolved the lexical misunderstanding; we left the stout stick with the front desk; and the bat was willing to fly out the window once it was dark outside.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'}],\n",

       "    'value': '<p>The focus of this post is the nature and modus operandi of the piànzi 騙子 (\"swindler; scammer\").</p>\\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13537968\">this article in Chinese</a>, scammers do not speak good Mandarin because having an \"accent\" enables them to carry out target screening.\\xa0 Such an argument may seem like a bit of a stretch, but let\\'s see how this supposedly works out through the eyes of two Mandarin speaking PRC citizens who have been the intended victims of the schemes of such piànzi 騙子, who pose as representing banks and other financial institutions, public security bureaus, and so forth.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b>I</b></p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The article suggests that there are three reasons why phone scammers speak in strong topolect accents rather than standard Mandarin:1. Accent serves as a \"mechanism of filtration\", because those who are not sensitive enough to non-Mandarin accents and who can\\'t recognize what is or is not Mandarin are more prone to fraud. 2. The scammers are simply not capable of speaking standard Mandarin given the current situation of Mandarin popularization in China. The scammers are more likely to be unschooled, and they usually share the same accent. 3. It is because of the high illiteracy rate in China that many people can\\'t tell frauds from reliable phone calls made by authentic institutions.</div>\\n<p><span id=\"more-51633\"></span></p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I think the article\\'s explanation makes some sense to a certain extent because in most cases, the staff of banks, government bureaus, census offices, courts, and police, etc., whom scammers often impersonate are required to speak standard Mandarin when making phone calls. As a result, most people would assume that the caller must be a scammer if he/she speaks in broad accents. And those who can\\'t tell topolects from Mandarin and who lack the opportunity to get to know this common sense (that Mandarin is used in such calls when they are genuine) are thus more likely to be deceived. This point of view reflects, if not strengthens, the absolute domination of Mandarin and marginalization of topolects in China, and I think it unfairly associates the inability of speaking and recognizing Mandarin with ignorance and low intelligence. \\xa0\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Personally, I don\\'t think the scammers deliberately use topolect accents instead of Mandarin when making phone frauds.\\xa0 It\\'s just the way they talk in everyday life.</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b>II</b></div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The reasons given in the article make sense. Most members of a swindler group are from the same village. Such schemes are a popular form of business at the beginning of their growth, like other legal township business in China, especially in the southern provinces. Then the swindlers find it\\'s an efficient way to lock in their victims. For most of the swindle calls I received, the speakers had an accent of the southern provinces. There was only one exception when I received a call of a woman with Beijing accent who sounded about forty or fifty asking me to pay a visit to the police station in the area of my former work unit. I almost believed her, but when I called back, it was an invalid number. Still I can\\'t understand what profit the swindler can make by asking me to pay a visit to a police station? In the past 2-3 years, I haven\\'t received any calls from swindlers. Instead, it is the calls from real estate agents that favor me from time to time now.</div>\\n<p>Other respondents point out that some swindlers and scammers do speak decent Mandarin, but they are definitely few in number and not nearly so successful as those who speak heavily accented topolects.</p>\\n<p>In my estimation, the article makes a lot of dubious, if not specious, assumptions about people who speak with accents.\\xa0 My guess is that a deeper motivation for the writing of this article is that its authors lament the low percentage of people in China who actually speak standard Mandarin.\\xa0 If you watch videos of newscasts or unrehearsed street speech on social media in China &#8212; e.g., recordings of people reacting to the floods in Henan &#8212; much of it is very hard to understand if you only know standard Mandarin.\\xa0 Henan accent is thus strongly marked &#8212; even though Henan is smack dab in the center of the Mandarin speaking areas of China &#8212; and, to one degree or another, constitutes a barrier to free and unimpeded communication with persons from other parts of the country.\\xa0 Because the authors of the article are disappointed by the low level of language unification throughout China, they attempt to stigmatize non-MSM (Modern Standard Mandarin) speech as associated with disreputable and even criminal types.\\xa0 The converse of all this besmirching of accented speech is that people who speak MSM are more intelligent and law-abiding.</p>\\n<p>In my estimation, the situation surrounding topolectal speech usage in the PRC is far more complex than that presented in the cited article and needs to be treated more sensitively from sociolinguistic and historical angles if we are to arrive at a true appreciation of what it signifies.\\xa0 And this is not even to mention the matter of completely different Sinitic and non-Sinitic languages in the PRC!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=40839\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Dialect vs. accent (vs. language)\">Dialect vs. accent (vs. language)</a>\" (11/3/18)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48364\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Sinitic topolects\">Sinitic topolects</a>\" (9/2/20)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=41988\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to The Sinophone\">The Sinophone</a>\" (2/28/19)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=42029\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Sinitic languages without the Sinographic script\">Sinitic languages without the Sinographic script</a>\" (3/5/19)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=25799\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Writing Sinitic languages with phonetic scripts\">Writing Sinitic languages with phonetic scripts</a>\" (5/20/16)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2423\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Dialect or Topolect?\">Dialect or Topolect?</a>\" (7/1/10)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4326\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 5th edition\">The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 5th edition</a>\" (11/14/12)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4615\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to \">\\'Chinese\\' well beyond Mandarin</a>\" (5/10/13)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>[Thanks to Yijie Zhang, Tong Wang, and Chenfeng Wang]</p>'}],\n",

The earliest OED citation for that sense is from 1981:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>1981</strong> <em>Washington Post</em> (Nexis) 24 Sept. f1 Folks think Leonard has gotten above his raisings, moving out to a mansion in the country, and..has forgotten other black men&#8230; Mike McDaniel would fight you before agreeing to such trash talk.<br />\\n<strong>1990 </strong> <em>Sports Illustr.</em> 4 June 48/3 He also amplified Janney\\'s nightmare with a steady stream of trash talk and a maniacal grin.<br />\\n<strong>2000</strong> <em>Time</em> 18 Dec. 43/1 The five..conservatives..voted to issue the stay&#8230; The dissenters concluded that the majority had ‘acted unwisely’—which passes for serious trash talk on the high court.</p>\\n<p>The 1981 WaPo citation implies that the term was already in general use at that point. I think I remember \"trash talk\" being used in an athletic context in the 1960s. But the semantic drift involved is so natural and gradual that the cumulative innovations in usage may have happened multiple times.</p>\\n<p>The original meaning of the word <em>trash,</em> according to the OED, was \"That which is broken, snapped, or lopped off anything in preparing it for use; broken or torn pieces, as twigs, splinters, ‘cuttings from a hedge, small wood from a copse’ (\\xa0<em>Eng. Dial. Dict.</em>), straw, rags; refuse\", with citations to 1555.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>1555</strong> Bill in Chancery in <em>Athenæum</em> 17 July (1886) 92/2 A carpenter\\'s yarde, wherein he dothe laye his tymber and Trasshe.<br />\\n<strong>1574</strong> E.

(Said of things material or immaterial)\" seems to have been instant &#8212; the OED\\'s citations date from 1529, earlier than the literal (?) sense:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>a1529</strong> J.

Parsons <em>Disposal of Municipal Refuse</em> iii. 21 Rubbish is discarded trash, composed principally of all kinds of paper, wood, rags, mattresses, bedding, boxes,..tin cans,..bottles,..and the like.<br />\\n<strong>1925</strong> <em>Amer.

McAdoo <em>Crowded Years</em> i. 12 The abandoned..building&#8230; Its steps were littered with trash, and many..windows were broken.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m certain that cultural norms for abuse of opponents, in athletic as well as military contests, have been around for a long time &#8212; there\\'s some trash talk in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2017&amp;version=KJV\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the story of David and Goliath</a>, for example.</p>\\n<p>But the question for today is, when and where did the term \"trash talk\" start being used in its modern athletic sense?</p>\\n<p>The New York Times doesn\\'t start using the term in the sports section until the 1990s, though at that point they assume that everybody knows what it means &#8212; e.g. Robert Lipsyte, \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/sports/pro-basketball-the-art-of-trash-talk-not-limited-to-a-court.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Trash Talk Not Limited to a Court</a>\", 6/5/1994:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Three of the greatest trash talkers in the history of sports &#8212; Muhammad Ali, Henry Kissinger and Marge Schott &#8212; made encore performances recently as if to remind the current designated mouths that there have been giants in the field. Call it Homeric boasting, bench jockeying, psyching out, trash talk is the latest label for a line of hostile chatter that goes back at least to Cain putting down Abel before eliminating him from the race. [&#8230;]</span></p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\">It was Ali, first as Cassius Clay, who brought bodacious black style to the global village as a way of talking his opponents off balance and publicizing his fights. He sold real tickets along with wolf tickets. The cultural commentator, Nelson George, has pointed out that Ali\\'s descriptions of himself as \"pretty\" was the \"mack talk\" of pimps and his assigning animal names to his opponents &#8212; Sonny (the Big Ugly Bear) Liston and Floyd (the Rabbit) Patterson &#8212; was in the African tradition of elevating oneself by dehumanizing one\\'s enemies. George even saw Bundini Brown, Ali\\'s assistant trainer for uplift, as a kind of Mr. Interlocutor from the minstrel shows.</span></p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\">The mostly black-on-black trash talking in pro basketball delights some, offends others. Is it a further expression of creative style (hip-hop hoops?), a reflection of street-corner desperation; is it indicative of the game\\'s tilt from finesse to confrontation?</span></p>\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=trash+talk&amp;year_start=1920&amp;year_end=2010&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Ngrams plot</a> also points to the 1990s as the starting point of widespread \"trash talk\" usage in the general literate culture. But there\\'s evidence of a relevant not-limited-to-sports sense in Black vernacular much earlier, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Story/q7YPAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22trash+talk%22&amp;dq=%22trash+talk%22&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this 1933 snippet from <em>Story</em></a>:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Story1933TrashTalk.png\"><img src=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Story1933TrashTalk.png\" title=\"Click to embiggen\" width=\"490\" /></a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'}],\n",

My wife had a character in her name that most computers will not reproduce ([石羡]), despite it being relatively common in names in our part of the world, and has been refused bank accounts, credit cards, and a mortgage because of it. In the end she changed her name rather than continue to deal with the hassle. The character is in the standard, but it was too late for us.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&#8230;there have always been ways to get the character onto a computer, but any given piece of bank software might not recognise it, and any given bank functionary might be unfamiliar with them. We then had trouble when some organisations used the pinyin XIAN in place of the character, but that then made their documentation inconsistent with her national ID card (which had the right character on it) and so yet further bodies would not accept them… It was the standard \"mild computer snafu + large inflexible bureaucracy = major headache\" equation.</p>\\n<p>An anonymous correspondent, a computer scientist, sent in the following remarks:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Phil H is talking about a character which is in a \"supplementary plane\" in Unicode (and similarly in GB-18030).\\xa0 Unfortunately, an awful lot of software was only ever tested on Basic Multilingual Plane characters.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span id=\"more-51625\"></span>The way I explained it to a Chinese friend was: imagine you live in a small town where everybody\\'s telephone number is 4 digits.\\xa0 Then they build a load of new houses on the edge of town, but when they come to connect them up, they find there aren\\'t enough numbers left to give all the new people 4-digit telephone numbers, so they get 5 digits.<br /><br />But none of the existing 4-digit residents want to change their numbers into 5-digit numbers, so they carry on having 4-digit numbers.\\xa0 And they know each other very well, and only ever call each other, and it\\'s very rare indeed that any one of them wants to call up one of those new 5-digit people living on the edge of town, so some of them still go through their lives thinking that telephone numbers only ever have 4 digits.<br /><br />Which unfortunately leads to some slightly-careless equipment designers testing their equipment only on 4-digit numbers, not checking if 5-digit numbers also exist.\\xa0 Which means, when you want to use a 5-digit number, you just might find that some piece of equipment which had claimed to be fully compatible with the phone system suddenly doesn\\'t work.<br /><br />(Oh, and there does exist a way to translate a 5-digit number into TWO of the 4-digit numbers, which is supposed to make it compatible with any old equipment that insists on 4-digit numbers.\\xa0 But some of that equipment doesn\\'t support putting two telephone numbers in the space of one.)<br /><br />If they\\'d insisted on giving EVERYBODY 5-digit numbers, then all the makers of equipment would have been forced to face the reality of 5 digits. But then everybody would have had to change, and that\\'s too awkward.<br /><br />At least a lot of Western designers are facing up to 5-digit numbers now. Why?\\xa0 Because a whole bunch of EMOJI characters are in that 5-digit area! So I think the way to get blog tools etc to support the extra characters is simply to say we want to use all the latest emoji: English developers can relate to that more than they do to rare characters in a language they don\\'t understand.\\xa0 (Just hope they don\\'t make some other assumption like \"if it\\'s a 5-digit number then the first digit will always be a 1 because that covers the emoji\".)<br /><br />Meanwhile China is, apparently, building new towns and cities which have the 5-digit characters in their names.\\xa0 That\\'ll make them more common, once people start moving in to those places and they want to write about where they live without having to use some cheap-looking homophone.</p>\\n<p>Does the anonymous correspondent\\'s analogy

Like them, he believed that the promotion of non-Russian languages helped power the rise of nationalistic and secessionist sympathies and movements and therefore suppressed those who had risen under <i>korenizatsiya</i>.<br /><br />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “History,” Yaroshinskaya says, “as is well known repeats itself. Today in Ukraine is taking place so to speak a corrected version of korenizatsiya. And in doing so, the present-day Kyiv authorities are acting in the best traditions of the Muscovite Bolsheviks.” The successors of the latter are reacting in exactly the same way too.<br /><br />\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But in doing so, they are admitting de facto what they publicly deny: Ukrainian is a self-standing language; it isn’t some dialect of Russian that can be readily suppressed.</p>\\n<p>Alla Yaroshinskaya is a formidable figure.\\xa0 Born (February 14, 1953) in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine and educated at Kiev University, she is noted, among many other achievements, \"For revealing, against official opposition and persecution, the extent of the damaging effects of the Chernobyl disaster on local people.\"\\xa0 (<a href=\"https://rightlivelihood.org/the-change-makers/find-a-laureate/alla-yaroshinskaya/\">source</a>)</p>\\n<p>In closing, I would note that the question of whether Ukrainian is a separate language from Russian reverberates profoundly with the contention over whether the major topolects of Sinitic are separate languages from Mandarin, formerly a perennial matter of debate on Language Log, but more recently and increasingly only an issue of concern for ardent Chinese nationalists.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><b>Selected readings</b></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=10891\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to What\\'re Ukraine About?\">What\\'re Ukraine About?</a>\" (3/6/14)</li>\\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4159\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to Tattoos as a means of communication\">Tattoos as a means of communication</a>\" (9/1/12) &#8212; see also under other posts about early Scythians</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>[h.t.

A nominally Christian nation speaking a language distantly related to Persian, the Ossetes have inherited much of the culture of the medieval Alans who brought equestrian culture to Europe. They have preserved a rich oral literature through the epic of the Narts, a body of heroic legends that shares much in common with the Persian Book of Kings and other works of Indo-European mythology. This is the first book devoted to the little-known history and culture of the Ossetes to appear in any Western language. Charting Ossetian history from Antiquity to today, it will be a vital contribution to the fields of Iranian, Caucasian, Post-Soviet and Indo-European Studies.</p>\\n<p><span id=\"more-51605\"></span></p>\\n<p>Table of Contents</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">List of Illustrations<br /><br />Preface<br /><br />Acknowledgements<br /><br />Historical Timeline<br /><br />A Note on Transcriptions<br /><br />Introduction: The Ossetes: Caucasians, Iranians, or Both?<br /><br />1.

However, I\\'m not sure that any dictionary or grammar accounts for a very special usage that I have long been intrigued and enchanted by, namely the \"ge\" in this type of sentence:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Wǒ máng de gè yàosǐ</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">我忙得個要死!</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"I\\'m so busy I could die!\", i.e., \"I\\'m incredibly busy!\"</p>\\n<p>Here de 得 is a particle marking the complement of degree.</p>\\n<p>Because I lived with a big household full of Chinese (Shandong) in-laws, I picked this construction up very early in my learning of spoken Mandarin, but I always had a visceral feeling that it was extremely colloquial and unlikely to be encountered in written texts and was probably not covered in conventional grammars.\\xa0 So I asked around among colleagues and native speaker informants how they would explain this unusual \"ge\", grammatically or otherwise.\\xa0 Here are some of the replies I received.</p>\\n<p><span id=\"more-51584\"></span></p>\\n<p>A speaker of northwest Mandarin says that she never heard this usage in her whole life and thinks it may be a southernism.</p>\\n<p>Here are some examples given by other respondents:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Jīn wǎn wánr gè tòngkuài!</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">今晚玩儿个痛快!</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Let\\'s have a really good time tonight!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Xiān chī ge bǎo zài shuō!</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">先吃個飽再說！</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Let\\'s have a full meal first, then we\\'ll decide what to do!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">One of my favorite insults:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Nǐ dǒng gè pì</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"VIiyi\" lang=\"zh-CN\"><span class=\"JLqJ4b\">你懂个屁</span></span></p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"You know shit.\"</p>\\n<p>I don\\'t think that any of these sentences exactly fit the paradigm of the original example, but they are illustrative of other idiomatic usages of \"ge\".</p>\\n<p>The following are some longer communications:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Maiheng Dietrich:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I don\\'t really have an answer for your question. I don\\'t think it can be explained with grammar, because the \"ge\" is not present in standard Mandarin máng dé yàosǐ 忙得要死. My guess is this colloquial expression fulfills or stresses a certain emotion of the speaker, similar to some people\\'s usage of swear words for purpose of emphasis or intensification (of course, \"ge\" is no swear word).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Zheng-sheng Zhang:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">So \"ge\" is not restricted to occur only after \"de\".\\xa0 One more example:\\xa0 Dǎ (le) gè luòhuāliúshuǐ 打（了）个落花流水。(\"beat somebody to pieces / a pulp\")</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"ta\" [3rd person pronoun] often occurs before \"ge\": 打他个落花流水。 了 doesn\\'t seem to fit here.\\xa0 I wonder why?</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Jing Hu:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I think that\\xa0 \"ge\" here in this sentence is to emphasize the speaker\\'s opinion / tone subjectively (in a colloquial language):</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1. to emphasize \"do something / or something is too big / to a great extent (subjectively)\"; \"个” is put between verb / adjective and complement, for example:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">喝（得）个痛快 / 喝（得）个一醉方休</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">玩个痛快</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">打他个落花流水</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">扫得个干干净净<br /><br />Adjectives:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">忙/饿/累 得个要死<br />脏得个要命<br />（there is \"死“ in the above sentences, so the adjectives are normally negative）</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2. to emphasize the small quantity/the degree is light subjectively (the speaker subjectively feels \"easy, relax, not a big deal etc.):</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">For example:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">面个试还这么紧张。</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">吃个饭还这么捯饬。</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">逛个街还这么麻烦。</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">一天走个十来里路不算什么啊！</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Anwei Feng:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I think I heard such ‘ge’ in a sentence like this before, but I don’t think it is always employed in speech. My gut feeling is that it might be used by speakers of a specific dialect(s) / topolect(s). The explanation for that ‘ge’ should therefore be best given by dialectologists who know that dialect(s).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Don Snow:</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">First, I\\'m pretty sure it doesn\\'t come from Cantonese &#8211; at least it doesn\\'t sound right to me in Cantonese (though I am open to correction from those who know the language better than I do). <br /><br />However&#8230;. I have been studying Suzhounese with one of the staff in my center, and asked her about this; she in turn consulted with some friends. The consensus was that inserting a ge in examples like the one you gave is fairly normal in both Suzhounese and in Mandarin spoken by Suzhounese people. As to function, it basically adds emphasis. So, at least around here, by adding ge instead of simply saying \"I am busy to death\", you are saying \"I am really busy to death!\"</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Neil Kubler:</p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Of course, Wo mangde yaosi is even more common but, yes, I\\'ve heard Wo mangde ge yaosi and my spouse (very traditional Beijing family who grew up in Taiwan) just confirmed that this can indeed be said, is very COLLOQUIAL, and is EVEN STRONGER than just Wo mangde yaosi.</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Obviously this is on the pattern of chi ge tongkuai and mang ge buting.</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Jerling (my wife) offers two more examples:</div>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">rang ni chide ge bao</p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">rang ni chide ge guoyin</div>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&#8212;</p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">In addition to my comments about Wo mangde ge yaosi that I sent you, I suspect it\\'s also \"Northern-style Mandarin,\" not Southern.</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\\xa0</div>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I\\'m in Taiwan now and casually asked 2 of my grad students and they had not heard it &#8212; one said it was ungrammatical and the other said he had heard it but only from Northern Chinese.

To me the construction looks like a conflation of both types, where BOTH ge and de are prosodically reduced markers introducing the complement. There is, however, a sizeable group of well-known scholars who consider ge as a measure word or classifier in such constructions, which would belong with the object, such that in sentences with both ge and de, de\\'s function would be to introduce a complement NP, which would be internally classified by ge. <br /><br />I am attaching three papers [VHM:\\xa0 omitted for this post] related to this problem: Sun Tianqi discusses all theoretical approaches proposed in the literature (and adds his own generative solution); Zhu Yubin provides a historical dimension since the Yuan period; and the old article by You Rujie offers a simple breakdown of the different semantic types of VP + ge vs.\\xa0 VP + de.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Zihan Guo:</p>\\n<div style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I hear more often expressions like “&#8230;(你)個頭,\" used to negate in an emphatic way or to convey irritation, complaint.

      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\n",

      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\n",

      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",

      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\n",

      "your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",

      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\n",
      "to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\n",
      "down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\n",

      "this town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\n",

      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\n",
      "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\n",
      "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
      "slanderin' his head.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\n",
      "connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\n",
      "highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\n",
      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\n",
      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\n",
      "take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've\n",
      "no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\n",
      "landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\n",
      "thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\n",
      "long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\n",
      "be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\n",
      "arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New\n",
      "Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but\n",
      "one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's\n",
      "Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the\n",
      "streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\n",
      "but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four\n",
      "heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\n",
      "showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\n",
      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder.  \"But come, it's getting\n",
      "dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;\n",
      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\n",

      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",

      "me in the dark.\n",

      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",

      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",
      "possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\n",
      "waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\n",
      "centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\n",
      "I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",
      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\n",
      "wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\n",
      "steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\n",
      "long straight edges are always kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\n",
      "of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\n",

      "upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\n",

      "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n",
      "dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\n",
      "Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\n",
      "of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\n",
      "among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\n",
      "gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\n",
      "even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his\n",
      "history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\n",
      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\n",
      "pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\n",
      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\n",
      "of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",
      "unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\n",
      "a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\n",
      "plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\n",
      "noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\n",

      "\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\n",
      "fiddle-headed beak.\n",

      "What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\n",

      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\n",

      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\n",
      "poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\n",

      "could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,\n",
      "then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\n",

      "After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\n",
      "that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\n",

      "the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt\n",
      "remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts\n",
      "Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about\n",
      "the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,\n",
      "going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\n",
      "decided that this was the very ship for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",

      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\n",
      "claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\n",
      "vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\n",
      "owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\n",
      "Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\n",
      "tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\n",
      "long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\n",
      "holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\n",

      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\n",
      "at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\n",
      "of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\n",
      "of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\n",
      "hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\n",

      "forward.\n",

      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\n",
      "of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\n",

      "style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\n",
      "minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\n",
      "pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n",

      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",

      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\n",
      "I could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\n",
      "though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\n",
      "go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world\n",
      "where you stand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\n",
      "the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\n",
      "this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\n",
      "his willingness to ship me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\n",
      "along with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\n",
      "with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\n",
      "other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\n",
      "a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\n",
      "wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\n",
      "plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\n",
      "their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\n",
      "approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\n",
      "to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\n",
      "the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\n",
      "modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\n",
      "these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\n",
      "whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\n",
      "vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\n",
      "Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\n",
      "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\n",
      "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\n",
      "led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\n",
      "language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\n",
      "at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\n",
      "so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\n",
      "all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\n",
      "with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\n",
      "indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\n",
      "Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\n",
      "whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\n",
      "Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n",
      "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\n",
      "man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\n",
      "This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\n",
      "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\n",
      "and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\n",
      "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\n",
      "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\n",
      "receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
      "task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\n",
      "crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\n",
      "hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\n",
      "for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\n",
      "least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\n",
      "somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\n",
      "out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\n",
      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\n",
      "work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\n",
      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\n",
      "economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
      "certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\n",
      "these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\n",
      "to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware\n",
      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n",
      "large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\n",
      "ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",

      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\n",

      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\n",

      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",

      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\n",

      "the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\n",

      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n",
      "what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\n",
      "strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\n",

      "him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but\n",
      "his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could\n",
      "not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the\n",
      "mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that\n",
      "uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me\n",
      "really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room\n",

      "\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break\n",
      "of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as\n",
      "if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first\n",
      "glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\n",

      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\n",

      "labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\n",

      "nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in\n",

      "sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now\n",
      "so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,\n",
      "argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\n",
      "the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor\n",
      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\n",
      "his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas\n",
      "turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",

      "passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon\n",
      "questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand\n",
      "that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all\n",
      "sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the\n",
      "custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to\n",
      "furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up\n",
      "eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and\n",
      "alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much\n",
      "better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into\n",
      "walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,\n",
      "perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\n",

      "an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh\n",

      "rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n",
      "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n",
      "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n",
      "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n",
      "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\n",
      "inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\n",

      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\n",

      "chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly\n",
      "calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence\n",
      "and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,\n",
      "more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,\n",

      "quarter-deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n",
      "recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,\n",
      "when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\n",
      "consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\n",
      "robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\n",
      "and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.\n",
      "Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\n",
      "down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\n",
      "disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly\n",
      "whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the\n",
      "straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning\n",
      "tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\n",
      "and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\n",
      "soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether\n",
      "that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\n",
      "desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,\n",
      "throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,\n",
      "especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head\n",
      "Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\n",
      "full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\n",
      "came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\n",
      "elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\n",
      "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\n",
      "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\n",
      "laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\n",
      "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\n",
      "preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor\n",
      "seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab\n",
      "should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he\n",

      "to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had\n",
      "previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned\n",
      "from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  \"Aye, he was\n",

      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\n",
      "of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\n",
      "cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\n",
      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\n",
      "the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\n",

      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

      "with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will\n",
      "try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\n",
      "they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\n",
      "the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins\n",
      "and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
      "included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish\n",
      "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of\n",
      "rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,\n",

      "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the\n",
      "whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing\n",
      "the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he\n",
      "attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,\n",
      "but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to\n",
      "olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the\n",
      "intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand\n",
      "distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is\n",
      "often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet\n",
      "long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an\n",
      "angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the\n",
      "slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin\n",
      "will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When\n",
      "the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical\n",
      "ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon\n",
      "the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle\n",
      "surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\n",
      "hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\n",
      "back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as\n",
      "some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;\n",
      "unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen\n",
      "waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\n",
      "misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous\n",
      "power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from\n",
      "man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his\n",
      "race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the\n",
      "baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the\n",
      "right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,\n",
      "that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,\n",
      "there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are\n",
      "little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed\n",
      "whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are\n",

      "In connection with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of\n",
      "great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\n",
      "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it\n",
      "is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,\n",
      "founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;\n",
      "notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously\n",
      "seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\n",
      "Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\n",
      "whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,\n",
      "back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\n",
      "indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any\n",
      "regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and\n",
      "more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\n",
      "whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this\n",
      "same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has\n",
      "baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the\n",
      "same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of\n",
      "whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any\n",
      "one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy\n",
      "all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock\n",
      "every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\n",

      "right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\n",
      "Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have\n",
      "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\n",

      "leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\n",

      "\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,\n",
      "arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a\n",
      "class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\n",
      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\n",
      "should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in\n",
      "some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,\n",
      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships\n",
      "and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the\n",
      "captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers\n",
      "are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take\n",

      "defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\n",

      "that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not\n",

      "King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\n",

      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\n",

      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\n",

      "when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\n",
      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\n",
      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\n",

      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\n",

      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\n",

      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\n",

      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",

      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\n",

      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\n",

      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\n",

      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\n",

      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\n",
      "the other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\n",
      "empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\n",
      "and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,\n",
      "does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\n",
      "gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate\n",
      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\n",
      "rocks must be shunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\n",
      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n",
      "There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing\n",
      "ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\n",
      "trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most\n",
      "part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\n",
      "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\n",

      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at\n",
      "the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much\n",
      "to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\n",
      "portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\n",
      "destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or\n",
      "adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains\n",
      "to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or\n",
      "any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men\n",
      "temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is\n",
      "the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin\n",
      "parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant\n",
      "cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about\n",
      "as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold\n",
      "weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a\n",
      "watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of\n",
      "its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even\n",
      "move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\n",
      "ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\n",
      "is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional\n",
      "skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\n",
      "morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\n",
      "cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at\n",
      "that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few\n",
      "turns in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his\n",
      "old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all\n",
      "over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\n",
      "walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\n",
      "there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints\n",
      "of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\n",
      "his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of\n",
      "his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at\n",
      "the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that\n",
      "thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so\n",
      "completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\n",
      "mould of every outer movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"D'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered Stubb; \"the chick that's in him\n",

      "the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n",
      "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\n",
      "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\n",
      "everybody aft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\n",
      "ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab.  \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and\n",
      "not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not\n",
      "unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after\n",
      "rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among\n",
      "the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\n",
      "nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\n",
      "half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\n",
      "whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\n",
      "that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\n",
      "a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,\n",
      "he cried:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"\n",

      "clubbed voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\n",

      "\"And what do ye next, men?\"\n",

      "More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\n",
      "countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\n",
      "to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that\n",
      "they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\n",
      "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\n",
      "white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"--holding\n",
      "up a broad bright coin to the sun--\"it is a sixteen dollar piece,\n",
      "men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n",
      "his vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\n",
      "of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a\n",
      "crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with\n",
      "three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of\n",
      "ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my\n",
      "boys!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\n",
      "hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\n",

      "white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\n",
      "more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention\n",
      "of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\n",
      "separately touched by some specific recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same\n",

      "\"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\" said\n",
      "the Gay-Header deliberately.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\n",

      "and round as though uncorking a bottle--\"like him--him--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\n",
      "and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a\n",
      "whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\n",
      "the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like\n",
      "a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab,\" said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus\n",
      "far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\n",
      "seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye,\n",
      "my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick\n",
      "that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye,\" he\n",
      "shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\n",
      "heart-stricken moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale\n",
      "that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\n",
      "Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted\n",
      "out: \"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the\n",
      "Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames\n",
      "before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to\n",
      "chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of\n",
      "earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,\n",
      "men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\n",

      "Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.  \"God bless ye,\n",
      "men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this\n",
      "long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?\n",
      "art not game for Moby Dick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,\n",
      "Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest\n",

      "act, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning\n",
      "thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the\n",
      "unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How\n",
      "can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?\n",
      "To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I\n",

      "me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice\n",
      "sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be\n",
      "the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak\n",

      "the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy\n",

      "itself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I\n",
      "meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish\n",
      "cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the\n",

      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n",

      "naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\n",
      "to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\n",
      "be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\n",
      "blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\n",

      "days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\n",
      "induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\n",
      "new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\n",
      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\n",
      "eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\n",

      "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\n",
      "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\n",
      "who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\n",
      "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\n",
      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\n",
      "if offered.\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\n",

      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\n",
      "and the same instant of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",

      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\n",
      "the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\n",
      "most widely distant points.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\n",

      "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\n",
      "in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\n",
      "strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much\n",
      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\n",
      "his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\n",
      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\n",
      "those who knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\n",
      "distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally\n",
      "justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\n",
      "a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\n",
      "spangled with golden gleamings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\n",

      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\n",
      "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\n",
      "assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\n",
      "exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\n",
      "several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\n",
      "upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\n",
      "in consternation to their ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\n",
      "Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\n",
      "death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\n",
      "inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\n",
      "of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\n",
      "chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\n",
      "of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\n",
      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\n",
      "the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,\n",
      "had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\n",
      "seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\n",
      "whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly\n",
      "sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had\n",
      "reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No\n",
      "turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with\n",
      "more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that\n",
      "ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\n",
      "vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\n",
      "frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all\n",
      "his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\n",
      "exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\n",
      "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\n",
      "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\n",
      "half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the\n",
      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\n",
      "it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\n",
      "white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that\n",
      "most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all\n",
      "truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\n",
      "brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to\n",
      "crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable\n",
      "in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all\n",
      "the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and\n",

      "That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,\n",
      "that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the\n",

      "and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in\n",

      "that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\n",
      "sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\n",

      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium\n",

      "orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\n",
      "now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human\n",
      "madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you\n",
      "think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still\n",
      "subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\n",
      "contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\n",

      "been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\n",
      "natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became\n",
      "the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his\n",
      "special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned\n",

      "that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\n",
      "purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\n",
      "transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\n",
      "charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then\n",
      "seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\n",
      "various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but\n",
      "steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\n",
      "blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside\n",
      "him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on\n",
      "various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been\n",
      "captured or seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over\n",
      "his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n",
      "ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\n",
      "brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out\n",
      "lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was\n",
      "also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\n",
      "forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",
      "cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they\n",
      "were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\n",
      "and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans\n",
      "before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a\n",
      "view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of\n",
      "his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\n",
      "it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\n",
      "creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it\n",
      "seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and\n",
      "thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,\n",
      "also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\n",
      "him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\n",
      "almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be\n",
      "upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n",
      "sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\n",
      "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n",
      "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n",
      "collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\n",
      "correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n",
      "an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n",
      "of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days\n",
      "that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two\n",
      "others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,\n",
      "have been seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\n",
      "the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,\n",
      "secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are\n",
      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\n",
      "for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\n",
      "by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\n",
      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\n",
      "world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\n",
      "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\n",
      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\n",
      "not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\n",
      "would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\n",
      "after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\n",
      "and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\n",
      "like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\n",
      "breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\n",
      "over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover\n",
      "his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure\n",
      "who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps\n",
      "with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his\n",

      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\n",
      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\n",
      "yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and\n",
      "with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\n",
      "escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\n",
      "at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\n",
      "For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\n",
      "hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\n",
      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\n",
      "again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;\n",
      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\n",
      "soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\n",
      "purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against\n",
      "gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its\n",

      "which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and\n",
      "unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of\n",
      "bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\n",
      "time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of\n",
      "living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\n",

      "circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\n",
      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\n",
      "together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\n",

      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\n",

      "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\n",
      "and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\n",
      "sailed from home.\n",

      "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\n",

      "\n",
      "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\n",
      "the modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\n",
      "beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\n",
      "minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\n",
      "illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you\n",
      "will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\n",
      "this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that\n",
      "these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\n",

      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",

      "connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n",
      "and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\n",

      "have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\n",

      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\n",
      "of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",
      "substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\n",
      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",
      "according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\n",

      "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used\n",

      "brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n",
      "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n",
      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n",

      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\n",
      "knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\n",

      "hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the\n",
      "thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we\n",

      "landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had\n",
      "cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The\n",

      "actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above\n",

      "Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\n",
      "gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at\n",
      "their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable\n",

      "any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a\n",
      "leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,\n",
      "some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a\n",
      "little anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was\n",
      "found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern\n",
      "manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.\n",
      "He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,\n",
      "and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,\n",
      "was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of\n",
      "nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,\n",
      "unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently\n",
      "imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about\n",
      "the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only\n",
      "on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were\n",
      "working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\n",
      "gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\n",
      "continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\n",
      "mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across\n",
      "the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee\n",

      "significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway\n",
      "against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and\n",
      "bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize\n",
      "that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\n",

      "with his gay banterings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n",
      "one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!\n",
      "I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had\n",
      "best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,\n",
      "boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a\n",
      "gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and\n",
      "the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at\n",
      "the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here\n",
      "now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing\n",
      "the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old\n",
      "soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his\n",
      "property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a\n",
      "poor devil like me the model of his nose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,\n",

      "it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,\n",
      "lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty\n",
      "fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\n",
      "peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\n",
      "tension of life's utmost energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\n",
      "went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his\n",
      "face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from\n",
      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\n",
      "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\n",
      "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case\n",
      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\n",
      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\n",
      "as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\n",
      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\n",
      "valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,\n",
      "gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that\n",
      "sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And\n",
      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\n",
      "with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\n",
      "unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the\n",

      "still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\n",
      "remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed\n",
      "Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously\n",
      "commanding him to do his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",
      "his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
      "was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round\n",
      "the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking\n",
      "him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
      "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\n",
      "where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an\n",
      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\n",
      "Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\n",
      "it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek\n",
      "he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been\n",
      "branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer\n",
      "touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was\n",
      "stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\n",

      "lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it\n",
      "had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was\n",

      "shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.\n",

      "furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to\n",

      "the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the\n",
      "spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\n",
      "seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale\n",
      "rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his\n",

      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\n",
      "sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times\n",
      "when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,\n",
      "and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\n",

      "and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and\n",

      "when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\n",
      "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\n",

      "of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in\n",
      "the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\"\n",
      "In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\n",
      "represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over\n",
      "their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made\n",
      "of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\n",
      "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round\n",

      "to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale\n",
      "from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on\n",

      "the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let\n",
      "me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\n",
      "accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye\n",

      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness\n",
      "of mistake.  Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\"\n",
      "In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an\n",
      "alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\"  I do not wish to seem inelegant,\n",
      "but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\n",
      "for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\n",
      "this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\n",

      "he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing\n",

      "the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\n",
      "derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his\n",
      "scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his\n",
      "authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort\n",

      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
      "surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings\n",
      "have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as\n",
      "correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would\n",
      "correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride\n",
      "of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their\n",
      "full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated\n",
      "himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and\n",
      "significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and\n",
      "afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched\n",
      "line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally\n",
      "impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to\n",
      "preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of\n",
      "the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking\n",
      "whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of\n",
      "one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is\n",

      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at\n",
      "all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\n",
      "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.\n",
      "Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the\n",
      "library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a\n",
      "burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other\n",
      "leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\n",
      "inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the\n",
      "great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\n",
      "relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does\n",
      "to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity\n",
      "is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will\n",
      "be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the\n",
      "side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n",
      "human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular\n",
      "bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all\n",
      "these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering.  \"However recklessly the whale may\n",

      "may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with\n",
      "any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly\n",
      "way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And\n",
      "the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his\n",

      "and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they\n",

      "just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\n",
      "bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the\n",
      "stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is\n",
      "drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that\n",
      "prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an\n",
      "oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,\n",
      "and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the\n",
      "whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub\n",
      "floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\n",
      "obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered\n",
      "about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\n",
      "black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.\n",
      "Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this\n",
      "whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw\n",
      "so good a one.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\n",
      "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n",
      "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n",
      "Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n",
      "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\n",
      "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls\n",
      "are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\n",
      "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\n",
      "back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing\n",
      "through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,\n",
      "and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught\n",
      "nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is\n",
      "all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is\n",

      "they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks\n",
      "or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden\n",
      "pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping\n",
      "out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and\n",

      "productive subjects, grow the chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent\n",
      "mention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in\n",
      "length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale\n",
      "near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden\n",
      "extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly\n",
      "projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to\n",
      "its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a\n",
      "backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have\n",
      "two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first\n",
      "and second irons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\n",
      "the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\n",
      "instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\n",
      "coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.\n",
      "It is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that\n",
      "owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale\n",
      "upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\n",
      "harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the\n",
      "second iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already\n",
      "connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon\n",
      "must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,\n",
      "somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve\n",
      "all hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;\n",
      "the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making\n",
      "this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this\n",
      "critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\n",
      "casualties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\n",
      "overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\n",
      "skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the\n",
      "lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all\n",
      "directions.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until\n",
      "the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\n",
      "one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\n",
      "qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\n",
      "such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\n",
      "simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is\n",
      "supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the\n",
      "first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these\n",
      "particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\n",

      "\n",
      "Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a\n",
      "calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\n",
      "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen\n",
      "men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\n",
      "fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\n",
      "corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\n",
      "long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\n",
      "enormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of\n",
      "Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on\n",
      "the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile\n",
      "an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if\n",
      "laden with pig-lead in bulk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's\n",
      "main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\n",
      "dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly\n",
      "eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\n",
      "securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\n",
      "went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\n",
      "morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\n",
      "evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\n",
      "creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\n",
      "despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\n",
      "reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a\n",
      "thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not\n",
      "one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would\n",
      "have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands\n",
      "were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being\n",
      "dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.\n",
      "But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is\n",
      "to be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the\n",
      "bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's\n",
      "and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars\n",
      "and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together\n",
      "like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains\n",
      "standing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most\n",
      "reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored\n",
      "alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density\n",
      "that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\n",
      "side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low\n",
      "beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from\n",
      "the boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is\n",
      "ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden\n",
      "float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other\n",
      "end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\n",
      "made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\n",
      "girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and\n",
      "being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\n",
      "smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\n",
      "flukes or lobes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be\n",

      "betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an\n",
      "unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official\n",
      "superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of\n",
      "affairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,\n",
      "was soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was\n",
      "somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his\n",
      "palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and\n",

      "extremity of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\n",
      "lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti\n",
      "supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor\n",
      "was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling\n",
      "their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of\n",
      "sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its\n",
      "fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled\n",
      "by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few\n",
      "inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just\n",
      "see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black\n",
      "waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge\n",
      "globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This\n",
      "particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such\n",
      "an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\n",
      "symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\n",
      "things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened\n",
      "to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,\n",
      "sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like\n",
      "hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to\n",
      "bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while\n",
      "the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving\n",
      "each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,\n",
      "the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely\n",
      "carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you\n",
      "to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much\n",
      "the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough\n",
      "for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders\n",
      "of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting\n",
      "alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or\n",
      "a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like\n",
      "instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and\n",
      "occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\n",
      "hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when\n",
      "you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more\n",
      "jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a\n",

      "his own epicurean lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?\" he cried at length, widening\n",
      "his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his\n",

      "something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\n",
      "scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,\n",
      "came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,\n",
      "which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;\n",
      "this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of\n",
      "command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's\n",
      "sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on\n",
      "his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at\n",

      "rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;\n",

      "over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the\n",
      "other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the\n",

      "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n",
      "upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n",
      "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n",
      "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On\n",
      "the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a\n",

      "Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\n",

      "belted round his waist.\n",

      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we\n",

      "then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,\n",
      "it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese\n",

      "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\n",
      "the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\n",
      "hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\n",

      "\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales\n",
      "regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external\n",
      "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\n",
      "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we\n",
      "may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\n",
      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\n",
      "but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\n",
      "and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\n",
      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are\n",
      "an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\n",
      "observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of\n",
      "the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely\n",
      "and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite\n",
      "imperceptible from without.\n",

      "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\n",
      "knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\n",

      "toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\n",

      "barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\n",
      "the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his\n",
      "foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\n",
      "doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\n",
      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\n",
      "an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\n",
      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\n",
      "has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with\n",
      "all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\n",
      "depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n",
      "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\n",
      "and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n",
      "visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin\n",
      "threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an\n",
      "eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.\n",
      "Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--\"Canst\n",

      "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines\n",
      "suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to\n",
      "them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,\n",
      "so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,\n",
      "relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\n",

      "\n",
      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",
      "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\n",
      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land\n",
      "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\n",
      "veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\n",
      "instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one\n",
      "of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure\n",
      "of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point\n",
      "as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\n",
      "arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary\n",
      "pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may\n",
      "be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\n",
      "quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\n",
      "fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\n",
      "considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\n",
      "source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.\n",
      "Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew\n",
      "over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\n",
      "were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was\n",
      "only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture\n",
      "into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no\n",
      "vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they\n",
      "significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,\n",
      "were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of\n",
      "the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's\n",
      "eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable\n",
      "to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one\n",
      "arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\n",
      "order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and\n",
      "also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\n",
      "inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last\n",
      "he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,\n",
      "the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\n",
      "swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\n",
      "glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\n",
      "and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,\n",
      "so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\n",
      "the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\n",
      "with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\n",
      "waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a\n",
      "log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As\n",
      "when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\n",
      "mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\n",
      "spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying\n",
      "spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n",
      "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n",
      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\n",
      "spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\n",
      "his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\n",
      "the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\n",
      "captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\n",
      "prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\n",
      "needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\n",
      "to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\n",
      "the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\n",
      "the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\n",
      "that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'\n",
      "West Indian long before America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\n",
      "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\n",
      "tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\n",
      "affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\n",
      "indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\n",
      "still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\n",
      "command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\n",
      "strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\n",
      "were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of\n",
      "the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The\n",
      "ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks\n",
      "and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\n",
      "dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon\n",
      "the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;\n",
      "and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\n",
      "not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of\n",
      "ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on\n",
      "the point of going over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in\n",
      "such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do\n",
      "something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your\n",
      "handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\n",
      "cut the big chains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knife?  Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\n",
      "slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of\n",
      "sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\n",
      "With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\n",
      "the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\n",
      "that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\n",
      "fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\n",
      "him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and\n",
      "swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm\n",
      "flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\n",
      "these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
      "accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,\n",
      "twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt\n",
      "imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\n",
      "Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a\n",
      "ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there\n",
      "are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\n",
      "the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the\n",
      "reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to\n",
      "a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A\n",
      "line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore\n",
      "Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right\n",

      "One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\n",
      "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\n",
      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",
      "represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity\n",

      "Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the\n",
      "fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his\n",
      "swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative\n",
      "answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\n",
      "consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily\n",
      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\n",
      "in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would\n",
      "accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",
      "players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\n",

      "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.\n",
      "But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\n",
      "exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\n",
      "body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\n",
      "campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\n",
      "Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\n",
      "when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\n",
      "effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\n",
      "whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n",
      "Whale,\" as some craft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the\n",

      "passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another\n",

      "mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale\n",
      "will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his\n",
      "other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets\n",
      "seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\n",

      "told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.\n",
      "Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are\n",
      "different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale\n",
      "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,\n",
      "too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all\n",
      "the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could\n",
      "this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms\n",

      "water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be\n",
      "arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm\n",

      "retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the\n",
      "whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so\n",
      "strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what\n",
      "has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that\n",

      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\n",
      "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\n",
      "laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question\n",
      "returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\n",
      "whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled\n",
      "breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in\n",
      "at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain\n",
      "that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but\n",
      "it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n",
      "through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing\n",
      "would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.\n",
      "But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he\n",

      "from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a\n",
      "close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water\n",
      "cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that\n",
      "you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\n",
      "that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know\n",
      "that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\n",
      "spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\n",

      "sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in\n",

      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching\n",
      "the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be\n",
      "peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your\n",
      "pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even\n",
      "when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the\n",
      "jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from\n",
      "the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who\n",
      "coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\n",
      "scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin\n",
      "peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the\n",
      "spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I\n",

      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point\n",
      "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\n",
      "square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\n",
      "than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\n",

      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\n",

      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",

      "middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\n",
      "as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\n",
      "Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\n",
      "thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\n",

      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",

      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\n",
      "flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\n",
      "his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\n",

      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\n",

      "to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\n",
      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\n",
      "testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\n",

      "how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding\n",
      "her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to\n",
      "her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\n",
      "the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and\n",
      "in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\n",
      "fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green\n",
      "walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and\n",
      "bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,\n",
      "and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing\n",
      "and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of\n",
      "remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were\n",
      "infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these\n",
      "conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and\n",
      "ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been\n",
      "gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\n",
      "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\n",
      "Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\n",
      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",
      "harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\n",
      "gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\n",

      "passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some\n",
      "presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\n",
      "the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\n",
      "rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\n",
      "battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\n",
      "stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\n",
      "chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave\n",
      "animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\n",
      "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\n",
      "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\n",
      "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\n",
      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",
      "seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\n",
      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\n",
      "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\n",
      "of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\n",
      "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\n",
      "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\n",
      "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\n",
      "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\n",
      "But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\n",
      "creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\n",
      "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\n",
      "horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\n",
      "in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest\n",
      "alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\n",
      "Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\n",
      "whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth\n",
      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\n",
      "the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\n",
      "in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\n",
      "embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\n",
      "three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\n",
      "time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\n",
      "boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\n",
      "mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\n",
      "been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\n",
      "extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\n",
      "precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\n",
      "unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\n",
      "may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\n",
      "becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\n",
      "fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\n",
      "was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\n",
      "snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\n",
      "it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\n",
      "Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\n",
      "his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\n",
      "from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n",
      "shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\n",
      "while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\n",
      "if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\n",
      "mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\n",
      "reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\n",
      "towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in\n",
      "their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also\n",
      "seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from\n",
      "certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured\n",
      "some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a\n",
      "little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered\n",
      "from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\n",
      "reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,\n",
      "the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate\n",
      "side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\n",
      "plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from\n",
      "foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!\n",
      "him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one\n",
      "little!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\n",
      "\n",

      "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\n",
      "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action\n",
      "to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he\n",

      "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\n",
      "the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\n",
      "her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\n",

      "drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.\n",
      "Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,\n",
      "and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the\n",
      "stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously\n",
      "puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their\n",
      "olfactories.\n",

      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\n",
      "from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\n",

      "from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n",

      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\n",
      "a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n",
      "ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\n",
      "was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\n",

      "with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\n",
      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\n",

      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\n",
      "\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\n",
      "to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from\n",
      "a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a\n",
      "baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
      "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\n",
      "conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\n",
      "somebody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down\n",
      "into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the\n",
      "interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;\n",
      "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\n",
      "Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from\n",
      "these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\n",
      "hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line\n",
      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",
      "Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\n",
      "ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n",
      "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n",
      "while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon\n",
      "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\n",
      "give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\n",
      "his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\n",
      "an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\n",
      "almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\n",
      "when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\n",
      "turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\n",
      "His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\n",
      "chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\n",
      "beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\n",
      "increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\n",
      "there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\n",
      "of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\n",
      "into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\n",
      "a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\n",
      "with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\n",
      "this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
      "druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\n",
      "were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and\n",
      "come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\n",
      "that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\n",
      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",
      "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n",
      "carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\n",
      "grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\n",
      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out\n",
      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\n",
      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\n",
      "were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\n",
      "that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\n",
      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\n",
      "And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is\n",
      "that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of\n",
      "all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\n",
      "manufacturing stages, is the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\n",
      "slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\n",
      "is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\n",
      "thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\n",
      "did this odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n",
      "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\n",
      "rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\n",
      "be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\n",

      "genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever\n",
      "enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any\n",

      "Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for\n",
      "even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\n",
      "panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's\n",
      "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\n",
      "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\n",
      "his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\n",
      "temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\n",
      "illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\n",
      "ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\n",
      "in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the\n",
      "green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the\n",
      "round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the\n",
      "clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\n",
      "pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\n",
      "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\n",
      "sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery\n",
      "effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\n",
      "the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\n",
      "stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",
      "traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\n",
      "was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\n",
      "cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\n",
      "Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\n",
      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\n",
      "Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\n",
      "how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\n",
      "No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in\n",
      "his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come\n",
      "up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\n",
      "considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own\n",
      "timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar\n",
      "instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost\n",
      "invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the\n",
      "same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
      "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
      "miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n",
      "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;\n",
      "such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his\n",
      "finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned\n",
      "entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,\n",
      "where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro\n",
      "before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\n",
      "hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile\n",
      "eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral\n",

      "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\n",
      "to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own\n",
      "boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\n",
      "fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\n",
      "roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and\n",

      "\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See you this?\" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Man my boat!\" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars\n",
      "near him--\"Stand by to lower!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",
      "crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\n",
      "stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the\n",
      "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of\n",
      "his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\n",
      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\n",
      "mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\n",
      "rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,\n",
      "it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\n",
      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n",
      "to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\n",
      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\n",
      "now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\n",
      "hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope\n",
      "to attain.\n",

      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\n",
      "And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\n",
      "the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\n",
      "seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\n",
      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\n",
      "lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\n",
      "how affairs stood, cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there!\n",
      "Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\n",
      "two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\n",
      "all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\n",
      "sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\n",
      "and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\n",
      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\n",
      "aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\n",
      "that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\n",
      "did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\n",

      "been a telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",

      "\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\n",
      "began the Englishman.  \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\n",
      "time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\n",
      "my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\n",
      "that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could\n",
      "only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\n",
      "Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\n",

      "wrinkles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but\n",
      "on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\n",
      "\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\n",
      "all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\n",
      "fast-line!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\n",
      "know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not\n",
      "know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\n",
      "somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\n",
      "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\n",
      "the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\n",
      "how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\n",
      "and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\n",
      "spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\n",
      "hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\n",
      "might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a\n",
      "whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's\n",
      "boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\n",
      "Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's\n",
      "boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and\n",
      "snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\n",
      "But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\n",
      "instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\n",
      "and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up\n",
      "out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\n",
      "sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\n",
      "sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\n",
      "iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\n",
      "cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\n",
      "first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\n",
      "chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\n",
      "clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\n",
      "and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\n",
      "went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\n",
      "towing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below\n",
      "his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\n",
      "Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the\n",
      "good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the\n",
      "whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I\n",
      "floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the\n",
      "way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the\n",

      "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\n",
      "the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\n",
      "his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but\n",
      "sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n",
      "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention\n",
      "between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in\n",
      "the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs\n",
      "of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of\n",

      "with the arm story.\"\n",

      "observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that\n",
      "spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\n",
      "and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\n",
      "ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it\n",
      "with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was\n",
      "threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that\n",
      "ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule\"--pointing at it with\n",
      "the marlingspike--\"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered\n",
      "the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the\n",
      "end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine\n",
      "once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this\n",
      "dent, sir\"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and\n",
      "exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the\n",
      "slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a\n",
      "wound--\"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;\n",
      "he knows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born\n",
      "with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such\n",
      "another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought\n",
      "to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,\n",
      "you rascal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What became of the White Whale?\" now cried Ahab, who thus far had\n",
      "been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two\n",
      "Englishmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried the one-armed captain, \"oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,\n",
      "we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\n",
      "didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\n",
      "till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard\n",
      "about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did'st thou cross his wake again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But could not fasten?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do\n",
      "without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so\n",
      "much as he swallows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to\n",
      "get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen\"--very gravely and\n",
      "mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--\"Do you know,\n",
      "gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\n",
      "constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him\n",
      "to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that\n",
      "what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.\n",
      "For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to\n",
      "terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,\n",
      "formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow\n",
      "jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,\n",
      "and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an\n",
      "emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible\n",
      "way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into\n",
      "his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick\n",
      "enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the\n",
      "privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case\n",
      "the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you\n",
      "shortly, that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank ye, Bunger,\" said the English Captain, \"he's welcome to\n",
      "the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but\n",
      "not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for\n",
      "him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in\n",

      "Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,\n",

      "fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of\n",

      "this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and\n",
      "hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where\n",
      "beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our\n",

      "For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain\n",
      "canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have\n",
      "no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,\n",
      "shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;\n",

      "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of\n",
      "the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a\n",
      "pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,\n",
      "with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\n",
      "round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his\n",

      "and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,\n",

      "be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's\n",

      "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\n",
      "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\n",
      "approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\n",
      "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\n",

      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\n",
      "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,\n",
      "and went eddying again round his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\n",
      "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have\n",
      "marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost\n",

      "slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\n",
      "vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\n",
      "directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\n",
      "pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like\n",
      "marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\n",

      "Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the\n",

      "that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did\n",
      "they appear with their clothes in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What d'ye see?\" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, nothing sir!\" was the sound hailing down in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\"\n",

      "All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\n",
      "swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they\n",
      "were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way\n",
      "aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between\n",
      "the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in\n",
      "the air.  \"There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a\n",
      "snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\n",
      "look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\n",
      "whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final\n",
      "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\n",
      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the\n",
      "whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",
      "spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\n",
      "silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and\n",
      "Indian Oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched\n",
      "men all around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and\n",
      "I cried out,\" said Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\n",
      "reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised\n",
      "the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there\n",
      "she blows!  There again!--there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn,\n",
      "lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\n",
      "whale's visible jets.  \"He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down\n",
      "top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,\n",
      "stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\n",
      "So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!\n",
      "All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.\n",
      "Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the air\n",
      "to the deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away\n",

      "\n",
      "Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails\n",
      "set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\n",
      "leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up\n",
      "Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\n",
      "sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the\n",
      "ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;\n",
      "seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the\n",
      "breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\n",
      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\n",
      "if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",
      "the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft\n",
      "Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n",
      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n",
      "bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by\n",
      "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\n",
      "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff\n",
      "rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered\n",
      "pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at\n",
      "intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and\n",
      "fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked\n",
      "on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\n",
      "invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\n",
      "with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\n",
      "leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\n",
      "fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not\n",
      "Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\n",
      "Whale as he so divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters\n",
      "who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\n",
      "ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\n",
      "vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou\n",
      "glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how\n",
      "many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\n",
      "among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,\n",
      "Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of\n",
      "his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his\n",
      "jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for\n",
      "an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like\n",
      "Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\n",
      "in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\n",
      "sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white\n",
      "sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
      "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's\n",
      "reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he\n",
      "gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\n",
      "wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\n",
      "The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\n",
      "joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\n",
      "across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\n",
      "but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\n",
      "Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must\n",
      "best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\n",
      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\n",
      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\n",
      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\n",
      "whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed\n",
      "bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's\n",
      "fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\n",
      "clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\n",
      "than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\n",
      "revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\n",
      "seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\n",
      "unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\n",
      "eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
      "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
      "case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,\n",
      "then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose\n",
      "centre had now become the old man's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\n",
      "ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon\n",
      "the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\n",
      "her!--\"Sail on the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him\n",
      "from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of\n",
      "it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\n",
      "shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
      "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he\n",
      "sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
      "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily\n",
      "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for\n",
      "a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one\n",
      "trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails\n",
      "came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\n",
      "more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes\n",
      "condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\n",
      "kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such\n",
      "hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\n",
      "decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\n",
      "made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\n",
      "centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\n",
      "inferior souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
      "one bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing\n",

      "off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the\n",

      "\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\n",
      "picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\n",
      "chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It\n",
      "was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the\n",
      "added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\n",
      "every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\n",
      "now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\n",
      "indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\n",
      "endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining\n",
      "at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\n",
      "vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\n",
      "the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\n",
      "Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to\n",
      "their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\n",
      "previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,\n",
      "and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\n",
      "stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\n",
      "bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,\n",
      "methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly\n",
      "announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported\n",
      "as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the\n",
      "deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n",
      "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon\n",
      "now?  D'ye see him?\" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he\n",
      "commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore\n",
      "on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the\n",

      "\n",
      "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\n",
      "aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to\n",
      "a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched\n",
      "hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been\n",
      "dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to\n",
      "shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already\n",
      "over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,\n",

      "their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these\n",
      "things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great\n",
      "bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as\n",

      "\n",
      "The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\n",

      "one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;\n",
      "others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on\n",
      "the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready\n",
      "and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that\n",
      "infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after\n",

      "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken\n",
      "some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon\n",
      "proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope\n",
      "belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an\n",
      "orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges\n",
      "of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,\n",
      "as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less\n",
      "than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any\n",
      "calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\n",
      "fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;\n",
      "but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with\n",
      "his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\n",
      "booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\n",
      "mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\n",
      "miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes\n",
      "off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of\n",
      "defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
      "Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour\n",
      "and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at\n",
      "the fore.  The boats!--stand by!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
      "from his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\n",
      "one, rigged the afternoon previous.  \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is\n",
      "thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\n",
      "first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\n",
      "the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he\n",
      "told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\n",
      "straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\n",
      "certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his\n",
      "eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\n",
      "an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\n",
      "lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\n",
      "the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\n",
      "annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\n",
      "skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\n",
      "the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\n",
      "a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore\n",
      "every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\n",
      "three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\n",
      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\n",
      "him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\n",
      "rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\n",
      "first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking\n",
      "in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some\n",
      "snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\n",
      "sharks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\n",
      "harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\n",
      "flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.\n",
      "Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\n",
      "reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\n",
      "dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\n",
      "then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\n",
      "intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\n",
      "That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\n",
      "tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\n",
      "more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\n",
      "them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\n",
      "then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\n",
      "in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\n",
      "round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\n",
      "punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\n",
      "after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,\n",
      "while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\n",
      "twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\n",
      "Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while\n",
      "the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the\n",
      "creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\n",
      "of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed\n",
      "drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\n",
      "perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\n",
      "forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\n",
      "the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\n",
      "struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\n",
      "little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\n",
      "with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\n",
      "flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\n",
      "least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\n",
      "drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\n",
      "satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\n",
      "forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\n",
      "lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\n",
      "wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\n",
      "these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\n",
      "befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\n",
      "found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a\n",
      "comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\n",
      "day's mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\n",
      "as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the\n",
      "shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist\n",
      "him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp\n",
      "splinter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who\n",

      "\"The ferrule has not stood, sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up;\n",

      "\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even\n",
      "with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living\n",
      "bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost.  Nor\n",
      "white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his\n",

      "fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes\n",

      "lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\n",
      "veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\n",
      "fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\n",
      "waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Give way!\" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward\n",

      "fell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his\n",
      "broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted\n",
      "together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and\n",
      "once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from\n",
      "the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of\n",
      "their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as\n",

      "as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed\n",
      "round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns\n",
      "in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions\n",
      "of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;\n",

      "the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last\n",
      "encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was\n",
      "now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the\n",
      "ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to\n",
      "him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed\n",

      "face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel\n",
      "about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.\n",
      "Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly\n",
      "mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in\n",
      "the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and\n",
      "were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through\n",
      "the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb\n",
      "and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\n",
      "lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\n",
      "boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But\n",
      "he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the\n",
      "main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that\n",
      "perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and\n",
      "so nail it to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance\n",
      "to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\n",
      "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\n",
      "Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so\n",
      "rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start\n",
      "had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over\n",
      "the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously\n",
      "stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that\n",
      "the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in\n",
      "the sea, at almost every dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull\n",
      "on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water.\"\n",
